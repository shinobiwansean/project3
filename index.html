          <h1>Who am I?</h1>
          <h2>My name is Marsean Relaford</h2>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">I am the youngest of 5 kids I was born and raised in the small city of Savannah, Ga. 
            The first goal of mine I could remember was to become an astronaut, like every 5-year-old kid in America. 
            That didn't pan out as you can see so, it was time to find a purpose. Throughout my days in Savannah, I constantly struggled to figure out what exactly it was that I was meant to be or do.  
            Honestly, I spent most of my time involved in the wrong things. I had a passion for basketball, but it wasn’t strong enough to want to go pro. 
            I learned instruments, but never had a desire to continue past middle school. I even became a full-fledged cake baker and decorator under my aunt’s stead. 
            However, those skills dwindled away when I left Savannah for college.<br> <br>  
 
            Who was I meant to be? The question continued to burn inside my brain even more-so after high school graduation. 
            I had no time to think when college was knocking at my door and I wanted the first ticket out of my hometown. 
            College was an odd adjustment. My upbriging was a sheltered one so having that much freedom was unfathomable to me.
            I didn't take that freedom for granted and  I experienced many things for the first time.<br><br> 

            My college experinces consisted of learning how to skateboard, going to concerts and parties, getting a regularly scheduled gym routine, attempting to do theater, and much more.
            I made friends that would last a life time and some that would only last for a season. Everything was great! Although I struggled at first i eventually found a purpose. One that wasnt 
            set in a career path. My goal in life is to cherish and live in the moment for ever oppurtunity and experinces that come my way. I find joy in small moments and that is what i cherish the most.
